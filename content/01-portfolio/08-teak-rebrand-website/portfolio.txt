Title: Teak Rebrand Website

----

Text: For this project I worked with an awesome crew of creatives at Teak, a branding and content studio based in San Francisco. Lead by a very strong designer, we took this site through many iterations and came through with an amazing site to show off Teak's diverse portfolio and new brand image.  

Features:

- Responsive views for phone, tablet and desktop
- Custom HTML5 video backgrounds
- Custom WordPress plugins (small scale)
- Integrated page builder tool for easy page layouts
- 1,000 iterations
