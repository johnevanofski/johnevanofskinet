Title: Golden Gate Community Alliance Postcard

----

Text: This postcard was designed for the Golden Gate Community Alliance of Oakland, California in order to help spread awareness about the area's history and promote the GGCA website which organized community outreach and clean up events.

The cover is recycled however the back of the card was designed entirely by me, including a custom faux stamp, history information and a makeshift logo for the GGCA.

Tools: _Photoshop, Illustrator, inDesign_
