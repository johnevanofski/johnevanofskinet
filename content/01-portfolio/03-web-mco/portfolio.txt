Title: Mission Creek Oakland Festival Website

----

Text: I helped conceptualize, wireframe, create drafts, build and ultimately deploy the Mission Creek Oakland Festival website. Incorporating hand crafted designs and typefaces I helped get MCO a fully functional website that contained their monthly festival schedule, artist information and submission forms in one place.

Features:

- event calendar and custom built event slider for the homepage
- social media coverage and feeds from instagram and twitter
- zine style graphics
