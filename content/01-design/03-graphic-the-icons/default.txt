Text: This is some of the UI created for this site. Some icons got lost in the fold, but are still fit in the set. I wanted to use hexagons to represent the multi-dimensionality of my work. They can be seen as either flat shapes or cube profiles. I used flat graphic design and line art, all of it is completely original work. 

Tools: _Photoshop, Illustrator_
