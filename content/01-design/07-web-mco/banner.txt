Text: I helped conceptualize, wireframe, create drafts, build and ultimately deploy the Mission Creek Oakland Festival website. Incorporating hand crafted designs and typefaces I helped get MCO a fully functional website that contained their monthly festival schedule, artist information and submission forms in one place.

Features:

- event calendar and custom built event slider for the homepage
- social media coverage and feeds from instagram and twitter
- zine style graphics

Tools: _Photoshop, html & css, css3 animation, php, javascript (jquery), WordPress cms, Time.ly event calendar_
