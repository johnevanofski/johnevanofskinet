**About me:**

I’m a 27 year old living in the Bay Area. I started programming my computer when I was 13 using BASIC, I made music using MIDI generators and designed graphics in MS Paint. Now I use the Adobe Creative Suite, Ableton Live and FinalCut Pro professionally. I’m a web designer, technology educator and photo/video/audio editor. I have strong communication skills as well as an aptitude for new technology and languages.

I also like video games, puzzles, breakfast foods, synths, films, hiking, and sci-fi.
