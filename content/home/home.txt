**About:**

I’m a 27 year old living in the Bay Area. I started programming my computer when I was 13 using BASIC, I made music using MIDI generators and designed graphics with Gimp. Now I’m a web developer, designer and technology educator. I have very strong communication skills as well as an aptitude for new technology and languages.

I like video games, puzzles, breakfast foods, synths, films, hiking, and sci-fi.
